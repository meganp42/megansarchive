            <h3>Digital Literacy</h3>
            <p>For my Digital Literacy Project, a lot of my work was experimental. 
                <br>Glitch, Video, and Sound art were things I hadn't done before 
                <br>but I tried to keep the theme of replaying memories. For the 
                <br>final website, I based it on my oldest memory of the internet 
                <br>being customizing social media pages so I recreated Kim 
                <br>Kardashians MySpace Page.</p>
