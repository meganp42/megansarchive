            <p>This was my favorite project of the semester because I got to try the 
                <br>game design which is something I was interested in when I was in 
                <br>high school. I based it on a superhero character I created when 
                <br>I was obsessed with comic books. My final project was a text-based 
                <br>adventure game that will definitely become a personal project 
                <br>for me to develop.</p>
